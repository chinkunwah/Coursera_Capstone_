    "Mostly for those who first time visiting Bali, it will be hard to find the best location to stay where you may find good foods within a walking distance from where you stay. Plenty of dining options ranging from a casual cafe brunch, great tex-mex, quality local coffee, enticing patisseries and fresh seafood! Regardless of your budget, itâ€™s possible to have something different and exciting every meal but how can we decide the best location especially for the foodies. "
